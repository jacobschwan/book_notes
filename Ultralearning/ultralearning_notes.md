# Introduction

## Chapter 1: Can You Get an MIT Education Without Going to MIT?

## Chapter 2: Why Ultralearning Matters

## Chapter 3: How to Become an Ultralearner

# Principles

## Chapter 4: Metalearning: First Draw a Map

Start by learning how to learn the subject or skill you want to tackle. Discover how to do good research and how to draw on your past competencies to learn new skills.

**Determine What, Why, and How**

**Why**: Know why you want to learning

- Instrumental vs. intrinsic projects
- Tactic: Expert Interview - good for vetting instrumental projects

**What**: Deciding what to learn
Brainstorm all the things you need to learn for your project, then underline which will be most challenging.

Concept
: Ideas that you need to understand in flexible ways in order for them to be useful

Facts
: Anything that suffices if you can remember them at all

Procedures
: Actions that need to be performed and may not involve much conscious thinking at all

**How**: Your plan for learning

Benchmarking
: Identify resources that others have used to learn the same subject. Online courses, textbook lists, expert interviews, etc. Find the default curriculum.

Emphasize/Exclude Method
: First, find areas of study that align with the goals you identified in the first part of your research. Second, omit or delay elements of your benchmarked curriculum that don't align with your goals.

## Chapter 5: Focus: Sharpen Your Knife

Cultivate the ability to concentrate. Carve out chunks of time when you can focus on learning, and make it easy to just do it.

### Focus Problems

1. Failing to start focusing
    - Recognize when you're procrastinating
    - Start w/ just making yourself work for 5 mins
    - Build from there w/ Pomodoro Technique
2. Failing to sustain focus
    - Try to find *flow*, but don't stress if it doesn't come naturally
    - Break-up studying into sessions of about 55mins to an hour. Rotate topics.
    - **Distraction Sources**
      1. Environment - be aware of when something like music is a distrction and not an avoid
      2. Your task - if possible choose learning methods that keep you focused (eg video vs reading). Find way to help you focus though difficult tasks (eg taking note while reading)
      3. Your mind - negative emotions, feeling, worries. If they arise mid-focus: let it arise, note it, and release it.
3. Failing to create the right kind of focus
    - High mental arousal is good for simple tasks or intense concentration towards a small target
    - Complex tasks benefit from more relaxed focus

## Chapter 6: Directness: Go Straight Ahead

Learn by doing the thing you want to become good at. Don't trade it off for other task, just because those are more convenient or comfortable.

Traditional education methods tend to fail at transferring knowledge to practical application. Learning by doing helps increase transfer.

**Tactics**
    1. Project-Based Learning
        - Learning around a project ensure that you at least know how to produce that one thing.
    2. Immersive Learning
        - Immersion increases your amount of practice and exposes you to a fuller range of situations
    3. The Flight Simulator Method
        - If you can't recreate the full environment (immersion), focus on recreating the cognitive features
        - Situations where you need to make decisions about what to do and cue knowledge you've stored in your head.
    4. The Overkill Approach
        - Increase the challenge level to enhance directness
        - Put yourself into an environment where the demands are extremely high and you're unlikely to miss any important lessons or feedback.

## Chapter 7: Drill: Attack Your Weakest Point

Be ruthless in improving your weakest points. Break down complex skills into small parts; then master those parts and build them back together.

## Chapter 8: Retrieval: Test to Learn

Testing isn't simply a  way of assessing knowledge but a way of creating it. Test yourself to actively recall information rather than passively review it.

## Chapter 9: Feedback: Don't Dodge the Punches

Feedback is harsh and uncomfortable. Know how to use it without letting your ego get in the way. Extract the signal from the noise, so you know what to pay attention to and what to ignore.

## Chapter 10: Retention: Don't Fill a Leaky Bucket

Understand what you forget and why. Learn to remember things not just for now but forever.

## Chapter 11: Intuition: Dig Deep Before Building Up

Develop your intuition through play and exploration of concepts and skills. Understand how understanding works, and don't recourse to cheap tricks of memorization to avoid deeply knowing things.

## Chapter 12: Experimentation: Explore Outside Your Comfort Zone

All of these principles are only starting points. True mastery comes not just form following the path trodden by others but from exploring possibilities they haven't yet imagined.
